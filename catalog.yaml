        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they
          are completely unused and can be supplied with an arbitrary fill value.'

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they
          are completely unused and can be supplied with an arbitrary fill value.'

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they
          are completely unused and can be supplied with an arbitrary fill value.'

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.
