        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Turbulent Point Water Velocity is the measurement of current velocity,
          which can be used to derive turbulence data. Current velocity is measured
          within a 1 cm3 box by transmitting a sound pulse from the center transducer.
          The instrument measures the Doppler shift introduced by the reflections
          from particles suspended in the water, which is picked up by the 3 receivers
          that surround the center transducer. This data product is the eastward component

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Thermistor Temperature refers to the internal instrument temperature
          of the pH sensor, as measured by the thermistor (in volts). It is used to
          determine salinity and temperature dependent molar absorptivities in the
          seawater sample in order to make an accurate pH estimation.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Optical Absorption Coefficient is the rate that the intensity of
          a beam of light will decrease in response to the absorption (removal) of
          light energy as a function of propagation distance. The Optical Absorption
          Coefficient reflects the absorption coefficient for the combination of all
          seawater impurities including all particulate and dissolved matter of optical
          importance.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they
          are completely unused and can be supplied with an arbitrary fill value.'

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is

          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Vent Fluid Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) is a measure of the
          tendency of a vent fluid, and the chemical species within it, to acquire
          electrons (i.e. be reduced). The more positive the potential, the greater
          the affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced.

        comment: Vent Fluid Absolute Temperature refers to temperature calculated
          from the Temperature-Resistivity Probe Instrument (TRHPH) Thermistor and
          Thermocouple. It is calculated using response curves from Thermocouple and
          Thermistor Temperature (in volts) that are adjusted to the custom instrument
          design and corrected by laboratory calibration.

        comment: Turbulent Point Water Velocity is the measurement of current velocity,
          which can be used to derive turbulence data. Current velocity is measured
          within a 1 cm3 box by transmitting a sound pulse from the center transducer.
          The instrument measures the Doppler shift introduced by the reflections
          from particles suspended in the water, which is picked up by the 3 receivers
          that surround the center transducer. This data product is the eastward component
          of turbulent seawater velocity relative to true North.
