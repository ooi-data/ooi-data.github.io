        comment: Turbulent Point Water Velocity is the measurement of current velocity,
          which can be used to derive turbulence data. Current velocity is measured
          within a 1 cm3 box by transmitting a sound pulse from the center transducer.
          The instrument measures the Doppler shift introduced by the reflections
          from particles suspended in the water, which is picked up by the 3 receivers
          that surround the center transducer. This data product is the eastward component
          of turbulent seawater velocity relative to true North.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they
          are completely unused and can be supplied with an arbitrary fill value.'

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Thermistor Temperature refers to the internal instrument temperature
          of the pH sensor, as measured by the thermistor (in volts). It is used to
          determine salinity and temperature dependent molar absorptivities in the
          seawater sample in order to make an accurate pH estimation.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Calculated sonic buoyancy flux data product BUOYFLS_L2 using the
          sonic temperature instead of the virtual temperature. The FDCHP instrument
          calculates the analogous FLUXHOT_L2 data product also as a buoyancy flux
          using the sonic temperature. In contrast, the (METBK) data product BUOYFLX_L2
          uses the virtual temperature in its calculation of buoyancy flux.

        comment: Flux of CO2 from the Ocean into the Atmosphere refers to the exchange
          of CO2 between the sea surface and the overlying atmosphere. CO2 Flux is
          estimated from the difference between measurements of the partial pressure
          of CO2 in the surface ocean and the overlying air. The flux is then estimated
          as the proportional difference of these partial pressures. The proportionality
          factor is parameterized using wind speed and adjusted according to sea surface
          temperature and salinity.

      - comment: Mean Point Seawater Velocity refers to the velocity (speed and direction)
          of a single "point" of water (in this case, a volume of several square meters)
          averaged over time-scales associated with surface gravity waves. This instrument
          estimates water velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of acoustic signals
          reflected by particles suspended in the water. This data product is the
          eastward component of mean point seawater velocity in earth coordinates
          relative to true north (accounted for magnetic variation).

      - comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Partial Pressure of CO2 in Surface Seawater refers to the pressure
          that would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. pCO2 in surface seawater is determined optically by
          measuring the infrared absorbance level of CO2.

        comment: Flux of CO2 from the Ocean into the Atmosphere refers to the exchange
          of CO2 between the sea surface and the overlying atmosphere. CO2 Flux is
          estimated from the difference between measurements of the partial pressure
          of CO2 in the surface ocean and the overlying air. The flux is then estimated
          as the proportional difference of these partial pressures. The proportionality
          factor is parameterized using wind speed and adjusted according to sea surface
          temperature and salinity.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Turbulent Point Water Velocity is the measurement of current velocity,
          which can be used to derive turbulence data. Current velocity is measured
          within a 1 cm3 box by transmitting a sound pulse from the center transducer.
          The instrument measures the Doppler shift introduced by the reflections
          from particles suspended in the water, which is picked up by the 3 receivers
          that surround the center transducer. This data product is the upward component
          of turbulent seawater velocity.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass because
          it is a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass because
          it is a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the

        comment: Mean Point Seawater Velocity refers to the velocity (speed and direction)
          of a single "point" of water (in this case, a volume of several square meters)
          averaged over time-scales associated with surface gravity waves. This instrument
          estimates water velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of acoustic signals
          reflected by particles suspended in the water. This data product is the
          upward component of mean point seawater velocity.

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

      - comment: Mean Point Seawater Velocity refers to the velocity (speed and direction)
          of a single "point" of water (in this case, a volume of several square meters)
          averaged over time-scales associated with surface gravity waves. This instrument
          estimates water velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of acoustic signals
          reflected by particles suspended in the water. This data product is the
          eastward component of mean point seawater velocity in earth coordinates
          relative to true north (accounted for magnetic variation).

        comment: Calculated sonic buoyancy flux data product BUOYFLS_L2 using the
          sonic temperature instead of the virtual temperature. The FDCHP instrument
          calculates the analogous FLUXHOT_L2 data product also as a buoyancy flux
          using the sonic temperature. In contrast, the (METBK) data product BUOYFLX_L2
          uses the virtual temperature in its calculation of buoyancy flux.

        comment: Flux of CO2 from the Ocean into the Atmosphere refers to the exchange
          of CO2 between the sea surface and the overlying atmosphere. CO2 Flux is
          estimated from the difference between measurements of the partial pressure
          of CO2 in the surface ocean and the overlying air. The flux is then estimated
          as the proportional difference of these partial pressures. The proportionality
          factor is parameterized using wind speed and adjusted according to sea surface
          temperature and salinity.

        comment: Turbulent Point Water Velocity is the measurement of current velocity,
          which can be used to derive turbulence data. Current velocity is measured
          within a 1 cm3 box by transmitting a sound pulse from the center transducer.
          The instrument measures the Doppler shift introduced by the reflections
          from particles suspended in the water, which is picked up by the 3 receivers
          that surround the center transducer. This data product is the northward
          component of turbulent seawater velocity relative to true North.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they
          are completely unused and can be supplied with an arbitrary fill value.'

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: The Optical Beam Attenuation Coefficient is the rate that the intensity
          of a beam of light will decrease in response to the combined effects of
          absorption and scatter as a function of propagation distance. The Attenuation
          Coefficient results from the spectral beam attenuation of the combination
          of all seawater impurities including all particulate and dissolved matter
          of optical importance.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they
          are completely unused and can be supplied with an arbitrary fill value.'

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".

          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: The Optical Beam Attenuation Coefficient is the rate that the intensity
          of a beam of light will decrease in response to the combined effects of
          absorption and scatter as a function of propagation distance. The Attenuation
          Coefficient results from the spectral beam attenuation of the combination
          of all seawater impurities including all particulate and dissolved matter
          of optical importance.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Mean Point Seawater Velocity refers to the velocity (speed and direction)
          of a single "point" of water (in this case, a volume of several square meters)
          averaged over time-scales associated with surface gravity waves. This instrument
          estimates water velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of acoustic signals
          reflected by particles suspended in the water. This data product is the
          upward component of mean point seawater velocity.

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at

          of a single "point" of water (in this case, a volume of several square meters)
          averaged over time-scales associated with surface gravity waves. This instrument
          estimates water velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of acoustic signals
          reflected by particles suspended in the water. This data product is the
          eastward component of mean point seawater velocity in earth coordinates
          relative to true north (accounted for magnetic variation).

        comment: Flux of CO2 from the Ocean into the Atmosphere refers to the exchange
          of CO2 between the sea surface and the overlying atmosphere. CO2 Flux is
          estimated from the difference between measurements of the partial pressure
          of CO2 in the surface ocean and the overlying air. The flux is then estimated
          as the proportional difference of these partial pressures. The proportionality
          factor is parameterized using wind speed and adjusted according to sea surface

        comment: Flux of CO2 from the Ocean into the Atmosphere refers to the exchange
          of CO2 between the sea surface and the overlying atmosphere. CO2 Flux is
          estimated from the difference between measurements of the partial pressure
          of CO2 in the surface ocean and the overlying air. The flux is then estimated
          as the proportional difference of these partial pressures. The proportionality
          factor is parameterized using wind speed and adjusted according to sea surface
          temperature and salinity.

          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Mean Point Seawater Velocity refers to the velocity (speed and direction)
          of a single "point" of water (in this case, a volume of several square meters)
          averaged over time-scales associated with surface gravity waves. This instrument
          estimates water velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of acoustic signals
          reflected by particles suspended in the water. This data product is the
          eastward component of mean point seawater velocity in earth coordinates
          relative to true north (accounted for magnetic variation).

        comment: Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration from the Fast Response (Fastrep)
          DO Instrument is a measure of the concentration of gaseous oxygen mixed
          in seawater. This instrument measures dissolved oxygen concentrations on
          shallow coastal profilers through rapid oxygen gradients.This data product
          is corrected for salinity, temperature, and depth from a collocated CTD.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Thermistor Temperature refers to the internal instrument temperature
          of the pH sensor, as measured by the thermistor (in volts). It is used to
          determine salinity and temperature dependent molar absorptivities in the
          seawater sample in order to make an accurate pH estimation.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Flux of CO2 from the Ocean into the Atmosphere refers to the exchange
          of CO2 between the sea surface and the overlying atmosphere. CO2 Flux is
          estimated from the difference between measurements of the partial pressure
          of CO2 in the surface ocean and the overlying air. The flux is then estimated
          as the proportional difference of these partial pressures. The proportionality
          factor is parameterized using wind speed and adjusted according to sea surface
          temperature and salinity.

      - comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

      - comment: Mean Point Seawater Velocity refers to the velocity (speed and direction)
          of a single "point" of water (in this case, a volume of several square meters)
          averaged over time-scales associated with surface gravity waves. This instrument
          estimates water velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of acoustic signals
          reflected by particles suspended in the water. This data product is the
          northward component of mean point seawater velocity in earth coordinates
          relative to true north (accounted for magnetic variation).

        comment: Partial Pressure of CO2 in Surface Seawater refers to the pressure
          that would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. pCO2 in surface seawater is determined optically by
          measuring the infrared absorbance level of CO2.

        comment: Flux of CO2 from the Ocean into the Atmosphere refers to the exchange
          of CO2 between the sea surface and the overlying atmosphere. CO2 Flux is
          estimated from the difference between measurements of the partial pressure
          of CO2 in the surface ocean and the overlying air. The flux is then estimated
          as the proportional difference of these partial pressures. The proportionality
          factor is parameterized using wind speed and adjusted according to sea surface
          temperature and salinity.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at

          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in

          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. It accounts for the tea-like color in
          seawater. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater can contain both CDOM and
          turbidity.

        comment: Fluorometric Chlorophyll-a Concentration is an estimate of phytoplankton
          biomass using fluorescence. The fluorometer emits light at a specific wavelength
          that is absorbed by chlorophyll and re-emitted as light at a different wavelength.
          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is
          a dominant photosynthetic pigment.

          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: 'Partial Pressure of CO2 in Seawater provides a measure of the amount
          of CO2 and HCO3 in seawater. Specifically, it refers to the pressure that
          would be exerted by CO2 if all other gases were removed. Partial pressure
          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
          with that seawater. NOTE: the following calibration coefficients in the
          parameterfunctionmap are deprecated: "ea434", "eb434", "ea620", "eb620".
          Those arguments are still present in the function declaration, but they

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Turbulent Point Water Velocity is the measurement of current velocity,
          which can be used to derive turbulence data. Current velocity is measured
          within a 1 cm3 box by transmitting a sound pulse from the center transducer.
          The instrument measures the Doppler shift introduced by the reflections
          from particles suspended in the water, which is picked up by the 3 receivers
          that surround the center transducer. This data product is the upward component
          of turbulent seawater velocity.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at

        comment: Fluorometric CDOM Concentration is a measure of how much light has
          been re-emitted (fluoresced) from colored organic compounds found in the
          colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in seawater. Examples of CDOM include
          tannins (polyphenols that bind to proteins and other large molecules) or
          lignins (polymers of phenolic acids) from decaying plant material and byproducts
          from the decomposition of animals. CDOM is not particulate, but seawater
          can contain both CDOM and turbidity.

          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass because

        comment: Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Concentration from the Stable Response DO Instrument
          is a measure of the concentration of gaseous oxygen mixed in seawater. This
          instrument measures dissolved oxygen concentrations on mobile assets, deep
          profilers, and moorings. This data product is corrected for temperature
          measured by the DO instrument.

      - comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product

          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a

          By measuring the intensity of the re-emitted wavelength of light the chlorophyll-a
          concentration in the surrounding seawater can be estimated. Chlorophyll-a
          concentrations can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as it is

          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt
          in a parcel of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless
          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.
