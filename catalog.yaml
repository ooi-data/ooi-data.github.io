        comment: pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.
          The OOI pH algorithm was updated to use an L2 product (PRACSAL) from a nearby
          CTD instead of a calibration coefficient. This changed the data product
          type from L1 to L2.

        comment: Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt

          quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature
          and pressure. It is approximately equivalent to Absolute Salinity (the mass
          fraction of dissolved salt in seawater) but they are not interchangeable.

        comment: Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct
          electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater, such as salt, increases
          the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such, conductivity can
          be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater.

        comment: Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ
          by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting
          one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove
          the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at
          a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor.

          pH ranges from acidic to basic on a scale from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral.

          of a gas dissolved in seawater is understood as the partial pressure in
          air that the gas would exert in a hypothetical air volume in equilibrium
